## BC DevExchange Adoption Pattern
### The Need:
Modernization has been identified as a ministry goal. To achieve this, business units are embarking on  difficult change initiatives that are tied to culture shifts within their organizations. It won’t happen overnight. Readiness to adopt new systems and approaches requires a plan. A key element of the plan is based on having the capabilities and capacity to deliver solutions that end-users value. The [BC DevExchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/){:target="_blank"} is an incubator for the promotion of  innovation.

### User Story:
As a member of the business unit executive, I need to have a knowledgeable team that is capable of delivering a digitally enabled product that meets the needs of our discerning users.

### Context:
Taking a solution that is nearing its end of life, identifying business scenarios (through client engagement) pinpoints the need for teams that can propose, design, and deliver solutions that will modernize the business unit’s product portfolio for the digital government era.

### Scenario:
Develop organization capabilities that allow teams to solve difficult business problems. Co-locate in the lab environment where teams can reside (physically or virtually). Get exposure to resident experts who have experience and knowledge in delivering solutions, based on Agile methodologies, utilizing open source software on modern, cloud-ready platforms.

### Solution:
-	Obtain executive sponsorship and commitment to form a dedicated team to [learn](https://bcdevexchange.org/learning){:target="_blank"}, experiment, and create a viable solution in the BC Dev Exchange lab environment capable of being transitioned to, and supported by, the IMB
-	Start the conversation with the [IMB Strategic planning team](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/imb-patterns#ministry-imb-imit-strategic-planning-pattern)

## Microsoft PowerBI Adoption Pattern
<span style="color: green">\*under development\*</span>

### The Need:
Executives and team-leads need to be able to ask questions about business data. Stakeholders want to be informed in real-time by looking at informative web sites without having to wade through complicated multi-tab spreadsheets stored on shared drives or file sites. 

### User Story:
As a member of the business unit steering committee, I need access to business intelligence that shows historical, current, and predictive views of our business operations, in order to provide the executive with the information they require to make informed, data-driven decisions.

### Context:
Business intelligence tools are a central organizational capability used to analyze, visualize, and share insights into business information. Structured and unstructured files and repositories contain a wide array of data sources that can be modeled and shaped to provide dashboards and reports. 

### Scenarios:
-	Provide regular financial reports, drawing on multiple data sources
-	Report real-time internet-of-things enabled instrumented data sources
-	Provide predictive views of consumption reports, based on field data

### Solution:

## Microsoft Dynamics Adoption Pattern
<span style="color: green">\*under development\*</span>

### The Need:
Digital government requires on-demand, reliable delivery of citizen-centric services that often touch multiple business units in multiple Ministries. Being able to provide a unified view of the citizen, while using various backing services each with separate data sources, requires a platform approach to service delivery. 

### User Story:
As a BC Government digital product owner, I need a platform that allows me to deliver a secure e-Permitting (as one example) solution that involves stakeholders from a diverse group of Ministries.

### Context:
Modern Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms, such as Dynamics, offer a diverse suite of products that allow government service providers to obtain consistent integrated views of their business functions by using a common database. Custom applications can be built on the platform, integrating workflows to solve complex citizen-focused solutions.

### Scenarios:
The Dynamics platform can been applied in a diverse set of citizen and service focused management systems including:
- Grant Management
- Registration systems / Registries
- Appeals Management
- Citizen Engagement
- Referral Management
- Product orders and delivery tracking
- Call Centres
- Marketing List Management

### Solution:

## Microsoft SharePoint Adoption Pattern
### The Need:
Collaboration is key to team success. Working in the open is a digital principle that requires on-demand access to information. Projects are mandated to follow core policy and OCIO records management. Files stored on network drives or in email folders are difficult to locate. A purpose built, secure (IDIR/BCEID supported) document repository enforces structure and file findability.  

### User Story:
As a member of the business unit working on a new initiative, I need to have a secure document storage site that my team and our partners can access over the web so that we can collaborate on documents for our project.

### Context:
Teams delivering a time boxed initiative create office documents including spreadsheets, presentations, MS Word files, and PDF documents. Being able to organize the document structure allows for efficient team collaboration. 

### Scenario:
Your initiative requires a central repository of project related documents, lists, and team contacts. Files should only be viewable to those who have been granted access to specific folders. In order to ensure that changes can be rolled back, a versioning feature is required. The platform should include an all-of-site search capability. The site will have a diverse set of government users but may also allow access to external authenticated users.

### Solution:
Before deciding on a completely self-serve approach to team based document management, engage the IMB SharePoint consulting services team who will examine your requirements and guide site design, configuration, and development. SharePoint is a flexible environment that includes a team site collaboration template which supports IDIR and BCEID user accounts.
-	SharePoint projects should be requested through the [IMB Project Submission form](https://citz.sp.gov.bc.ca/sites/CSD/IMB/PBS/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7bBF193C7D-E566-494C-A3CD-0795935672CF%7d&file=Project%20submission%20form_updated2018.xlsx&action=default){:target="_blank"}

## BC Dev Exchange DevOps Container Platform (OpenShift) Adoption Pattern
### The Need:
Successful application development teams require on-demand, consistent environments and do not want to deal with underlying infrastructure. Business units are looking for hosting flexibility.

### User Story:
As a product owner, I need to be assured that my full stack development team has access to a supported platform that offers an automated code delivery environment without having to worry about the infrastructure, so that my team can sustain a high frequency of feature delivery.

### Context:
As teams design and architect new IT-based systems that deliver business value, they are looking to adopt flexible technologies without the inherent lock-in that has come with selecting platforms in the past. Application containers are lightweight, secure, and scalable. Container Based Applications (CBA) are portable across a number of on-premise (OCIO-ES) and vendor clouds.

### Scenarios:
-	New or existing web based solutions that can be designed or refactored to run on the OpenShift platform
-	New product offerings that may have peak volume demands are ideal candidates to take advantage of the scalable nature of the [BCDevExchange DevOps](https://bcdevexchange.org/DevOpsPlatform){:target="_blank"} OpenShift container platform
-	ETL scheduled jobs
-	Application Programming Interfaces (API)
-	Solutions that don’t expect to have a high degree of ongoing development   

### Solution:
-	Obtain executive approval as described in the [DevExchange Adoption Pattern](#bc-devexchange-adoption-pattern) 
-	Identify a Product Owner and a Technical Steward for your project
-	Communicate with the DevExchange DevOps team through [Rocketchat](https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/home){:target="_blank"}
- Enroll and complete [Agile and OpenShift training](https://bcdevexchange.org/learning){:target="_blank"} offered through the DevExchange
-	Request a [GitHub repository](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/How-to-request-new-GitHub-user-access-or-repository-creation){:target="_blank"}
-	Request an [OpenShift environment](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/How-to-Request-a-New-OpenShift-Project){:target="_blank"}

## Progressive Web Application Capstone Pattern

### The Need:
Citizens and employees prefer to use their mobile devices to access information and services. Mobile devices are able to access on-device sensors and smart-phone/tablet features to provide a richer more engaging user experience.

### User Story:
As a citizen, I rely on my mobile device as my preferred way of consuming government services.

### Context:
Installable progressive web applications (PWA) offer an authentic mobile experience for users. A PWA allows a website to run on the mobile device when connectivity can't be guaranteed. Web-based solutions can be enriched to access on-device sensors (example: location services). PWAs allow users to self-install the solution without having to be published in an App Store. Solution owners can send update notices directly to the installed solution, thereby simplifying application management.

### Scenarios:
- Offline information services
- Store/forward data entry

### Solution:
- Use modern web technologies (such as React and Node.js)
- Investigate the [playbook exemplar](http://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020){:target="_blank"} as a “starter kit”

### Additional Information:
- [PWA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application){:target="_blank"}
