# Exchange Lab Operations

This repository is for the Github.io site that has documented guidance for Exchange Lab Operations in the past. Many of these resources include insights that remain relevant, however the site is not currently being updated. Some of the content may migrate to a new site that is under development.

Visit the site here: [https://bcgov.github.io/exchangelabops/](https://bcgov.github.io/ExchangeLabOps/)

The primary audience for this website is a BC Public Servant that is seeking support with developing digital capabilities - talent, methods and tools - to improve the way they delivery services.

A secondary audience is our broader ecosystem of partners, including:
- other public sector agencies within and beyond the Exchange Lab, who are seeking to deliver similar services; and
- private and non-profit sector partners, seeking to work with BC Public Service teams in the Lab.

This site also supports reliable service by the Exchange Lab Team, who will orient around and continuously improve these operations practices. Click the projects tab above to see what we have planned. Click issues above add your own suggestions for improvement.
