# Phase 1: Assemble and support a team to get started

By the time a team has reached this phase, key stakedholders are aligned around what problem the team will work on. They have funding, executive support, and a commitment to shifting their organization structure to support a cross functional, continous service improvement team.

Organizations have a few options for building a team.

**Source the talent internally.** This is challenging in the BC Public Service currently, as we have a shortage of talent that can do software development.

**Hire team members.** With approval of the the BCDevExchange, you can use [these job profiles to build an Agile team](https://psa.sp.gov.bc.ca/sites/HRSUPPORT/Jobstore/MTICS/Forms/AllItems.aspx), including:

* Developers
* DevOps Specialists
* User Researchers and Designers
* Product Owners
* Scrum Masters

**Procure a Team.** Most of our teams start by hiring vendors for a year to build the product and then mentor team members that are hired to continue improving and maintainting the product continuously. [We encourage hiring agile teams using Sprint with Us.](https://bcdevexchange.org/sprintwithus)

Once a team is brought together, we facilitate their journey.

## Resources in Development

The Exchange Lab is always learning what is needed to support new teams and orgaizations building their Agile capacity. We're planning to build these 

* A template or workbook to support figuring out funding (allocations of CapEx and OpEx)
* Case studies of how other teams have navigated this journey
