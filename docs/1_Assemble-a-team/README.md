# Phase 1: Assemble and support a team to get started for abhinav

These artifacts are offered as resources when a team is being formed and is starting to define the product it will build. 

By the time a team has reached this phase, key stakedholders are aligned around what problem the team will work on.  

## What we have heard is needed so far:
* A template or workbook to support figuring out funding (allocations of CapEx and OpEx)
* Case studies of how other teams have navigated this journey
* A Checklist of all the things to pay attention to (we have a document, but teams would like this accessible in a trello board)

Stay tuned as our team releases these things!
