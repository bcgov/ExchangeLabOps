# Exchange Lab Operations - Results and Performance

How do we know if we are successful? This is one of the first questions all teams ask when they set out to solve a problem.

Our team works from an impact map and is developing our performance management tools and processes to share in the open.

Here are some of the results of our work as of **December 2019.**

## Impact: Digital Product Delivery

**We aim to deliver digital products that meet people's needs.**

The Exchange Lab has hosted more than a dozen teams since 2015. [See the list of resident and graduated teams for the products that have come from the lab](https://bcgov.github.io/ExchangeLabOps/Resident-Teams/README.html "Lab products")

Note: We are working on ways to illustrate the return on investment for Agile product teams. 

## Impact: Learning and Community Building

**We aim to increase the digital delivery capacity of government employees and our delivery partners through formal training, learning by doing, and community building.**
