# Agile in the BC Public Service

Agile practices yield better results for citizens through faster and more efficient service delivery. This, according to the [Corporate HR Plan](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/forms-tools/all-employees/corporate_plan_where_ideas_work.pdf "Corporate HR Plan"), is why the BC Public Service is investing in learning how to apply agile methods, where traditional approaches are not meeting citizen expectations.

It is difficult to meet citizen expectation in a complex, fast-changing world. Agile mindset and methods enable teams to respond to change through direct feedback from users.
  * For more insight into the values and principles of an Agile team, please see the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org "Agile Manifesto") and its [history](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html "History of the Manifesto")
  
  The Exchange Lab is one place where public servants learn to be Agile. The lab incubates and accelerates learning through the experience of delivering high quality services. 
  
## From Bridges to Software to Public Service

Agile has its roots in Lean manufacturing and became popular in the software industry. Traditional project management made sense for engineering projects, but challenges surfaced for software development. In particular, waterfall project management limits the ability to make changes and involve the user throughout. The division of specialized teams and cascading hand-offs limits innovation, slows delivery of value, prevents responsiveness when we learn we need to change direction.

In 2015, we started experimenting with Agile product teams. We learned about the value of an [Agile Delivery Process](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Agile-Delivery-Journey?intention=LOGIN#error=login_required "Agile Delivery Process")  and culture, including:
  * Iteration
  * Team collaboration and communication
  * User feedback
  * Incremental delivery
  * Small autonomous teams
  * Bringing developers and operations closer together (DevOps)
  * Openness, transparency and community

The positive results are evident: there are over [12 product teams](https://bcgov.github.io/ExchangeLabOps/Resident-Teams/README.html) who have delivered high quality products within a year. Additionally, organizations that have graduated teams from the Lab are now embarking on broader Agile adoption and are creating more teams.

The demand for support from across the Public Service to become more Agile is increasing. While the Exchange Lab uses Agile-Scrum methodologies, there is interest in applying Agile values and principles more broadly. There is a growing community of people supporting each other to learn how to apply scrum and other methods.

## Agile Practices

Why do some organizations struggle to become agile?

There are structures and resulting culture that prevent agile practices. These are hard to change and we're all learning to do this together. There are some specific competencies and practices that organizations can start working on right away. Servant leaders at the executive level supporting autonomous teams is key.

Tips:

* Work in the open: Share information that would not normally be out there
* Talk to your users directly, ideally citizens receiving services
* Use modern tools and technology that support automation

### If you're interested in Agile Scrum in the BCPS, here are some things to know:

#### Teams
Agile Scrum Teams are made up of 5 to 9 dedicated team members, with at least 2 full time government staff
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Development team

#### Customizations in the BC Public Service
When there are limitations to hiring, we bring in contracted resources through [Sprint With Us](https://www.bcdevexchange.org/sprintwithus), a modern procurement vehicle that procures Agile teams.
